## GitHub and Git Configuration

Before you begin, you'll want to make sure your GitHub Account is set up
and configure Git (the software) on your local machine.

:warning: **GitHub =/= Git** :warning:
* Git is version control software. It's open-source and competely free.
* GitHub is a private company that provides both *remote* git repository hosting
and a community focused on development and open-source technologies. GitHub is
just one of several popular options for hosting remote git repositories.
