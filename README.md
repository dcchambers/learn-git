# Learn Git and GitHub!

A tutorial to help you learn Git! Follow the instructions below to learn how to
use git and submit your first code change!

This tutorial gives instructions on how to configure and use Git with both 
Linux-based machines and Windows machines. Mac users can typically follow the
Linux instructions.

Git is included by default on most Linux distributions. For Mac, y

## GitHub and Git Configuration

Before you begin, you'll want to make sure your GitHub Account is set up
and configure Git (the software) on your local machine.

:warning: **GitHub =/= Git** :warning:
* **Git** is version control software. It's open-source and competely free.
* **GitHub** is a private company that provides both *remote* git repository hosting
and a community focused on development and open-source technologies. GitHub is
just one of several popular options for hosting remote git repositories.

### Set up your Account on GitHub

* UW Health has an Enterprise GitHub instance running at https://github.uwhealth.wisc.edu
  * Sign in with your regular AD account.

### Install and Configure Git Locally

#### Linux/Mac

#### Windows

### Add SSH Key to GitHub.
* There are two ways to use git with a remote repository host - git-over-ssh
and git-over-http(s). When you clone a repo from GitHub, you can normally choose
either method.
  * Git-over-http(s) is disabled for the UW Health Enterprise GitHub Service.
  You *must* use git-over-SSH.
  * To do this, you'll have to generate a **SSH Key** and add the public key to
  your account.
  * By using SSH-keys, you won't have to enter your login credentials every time
  you push/pull something to/from GitHub.

#### Linux/Mac

* Follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/)
to generate a SSH key using `ssh-keygen`.

* Follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/)
to add the SSH **public** key (id_rsa.pub) to your GitHub account.

#### Windows
